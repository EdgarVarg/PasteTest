This is an Eclipse project that shows how to upload
an image file to server by pasting it in a browser.
This has been tested with Chrome.

*** Using the application ***
Deploy the application to a Java EE server like Tomcat.

Open the URL: http://localhost:8080/PasteTest/

Copy an image into the clip board.

Click on the grey box of the web page and then paste the image.

You should see a confirmation dialog showing where the server
has saved the image file.
